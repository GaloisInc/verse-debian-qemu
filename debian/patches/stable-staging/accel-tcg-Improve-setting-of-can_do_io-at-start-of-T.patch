Subject: accel/tcg: Improve setting of can_do_io at start of TB
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Initialize can_do_io to true if this the TB has CF_LAST_IO
and will consist of a single instruction.  This avoids a
set to 0 followed immediately by a set to 1.

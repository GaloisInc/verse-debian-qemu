Subject: hw/ide/core: set ERR_STAT in unsupported command completion
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Currently, the first time sending an unsupported command
(e.g. READ LOG DMA EXT) will not have ERR_STAT set in the completion.
Sending the unsupported command again, will correctly have ERR_STAT set.

When ide_cmd_permitted() returns false, it calls ide_abort_command().
ide_abort_command() first calls ide_transfer_stop(), which will call
ide_transfer_halt() and ide_cmd_done(), after that ide_abort_command()
sets ERR_STAT in status.

ide_cmd_done() for AHCI will call ahci_write_fis_d2h() which writes the
current status in the FIS, and raises an IRQ. (The status here will not
have ERR_STAT set!).

Thus, we cannot call ide_transfer_stop() before setting ERR_STAT, as
ide_transfer_stop() will result in the FIS being written and an IRQ
being raised.

The reason why it works the second time, is that ERR_STAT will still
be set from the previous command, so when writing the FIS, the
completion will correctly have ERR_STAT set.

Set ERR_STAT before writing the FIS (calling cmd_done), so that we will
raise an error IRQ correctly when receiving an unsupported command.

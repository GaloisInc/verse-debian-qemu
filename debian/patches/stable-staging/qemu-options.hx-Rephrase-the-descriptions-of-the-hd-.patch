Subject: qemu-options.hx: Rephrase the descriptions of the -hd* and -cdrom options
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The current description says that these options will create a device
on the IDE bus, which is only true on x86. So rephrase these sentences
a little bit to speak of "default bus" instead.
